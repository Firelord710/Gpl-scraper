Biskanté,sativa,,,,,,,,sativa,"Absolutely incredible taste and smell on this new strain from Alien Labs. Biscotti-style flavor with a pound of sweetness.

In fact, these dense and sticky little pine trees look like they got caught in a snow storm. The flavor profile is pleasantly sweet and sugary on the pull, with a prominent and biting tarry exhale. This strain will untie the knots in your mind and soothe the knots in your body just like a warm bath.
